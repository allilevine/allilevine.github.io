# The Subversive's Guide to Geospatial Relevance

The Subversive’s Guide to Geospatial Relevance is a collection of points of interest that challenge how we define historical significance. It’s like a tour guide, but instead of pointing out the usual landmarks, we’re gathering objects, places, and journeys that highlight contributions by people that aren’t usually recognized, either because they’re from a marginalized group or because the established view of history would rather forget the roots of change.

The Guide is live at [allilevine.github.io](https://allilevine.github.io/).

To add a city, add a folder named for that city to the root directory. Add an index.html file to the folder that includes the following:

---
layout: category
title: CityNameHere
category: citynamehere
---

To add a post to a new city, first add a folder named for that city to the _posts directory. Otherwise add an html file to the correct city directory to create a post. Please follow [Jekyll conventions](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/) when creating a post.
