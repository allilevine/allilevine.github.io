At the University of Toronto - St. George Campus (Hart House Theatre) there's a map celebrating the increasing visibility of LGBTQ athletes in the Americas as well as the increasing legal support for LGBTQ rights in the region. The map also indicates the number of trans people murdered in each country between January 2008 and September 2014. It's disturbingly the only statistic the map authors could find to measure trans rights, safety, and experiences in the Americas.
