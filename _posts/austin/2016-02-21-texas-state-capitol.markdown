In 2013 Senator Wendy Davis filibustered here for 10 hours in an attempt to prevent [Texas Senate Bill 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Senate_Bill_5), which severely restricts access to abortion in Texas, from being passed. Protestors [successfully disrupted voting from the gallery](http://thinkprogress.org/health/2013/06/24/2200741/texas-gop-rushes-through-sb-5/) and participated in a "people's filibuster," sit-ins, and [chanting from the Capitol rotunda](https://youtu.be/TK_vhyS7yRM?list=PLliks4UVuF2ROT28Yd0uh8XmfnBZ9MI6b). Incredibly, state troopers in the Capitol began confiscating tampons and pads after they were allegedly thrown at legislators, but [guns were still allowed](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/12/tampons-confiscated-texas_n_3588177.html).
