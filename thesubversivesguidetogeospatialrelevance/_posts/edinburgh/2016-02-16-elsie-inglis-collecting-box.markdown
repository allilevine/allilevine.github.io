There's a small exhibit entitled "Women at War" in the National War Museum (inside the Edinburgh Castle grounds). One of the featured objects is a Collecting Box for the Scottish Women's Hospitals, formed by suffragist Elsie Inglis during WWI. "The British government rejected the offer of military hospitals ran entirely by women, so instead Inglis and her colleagues ran hospitals for Britain's allies France and Serbia."
